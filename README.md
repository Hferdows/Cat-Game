# Pablo's Escape is a 2D platformer game where you're aiming to stay on top of the city buildings!
# Similar to Super Mario Bros... Collect Sardines instead of coins, and watch out for all the dirty city mice
# Increase your score by collecting the tins... however if you run into an enemy before you're able to jump on them, watch out for your health
# Hope you have fun playing my game, it was named after my dear cat Pablo! Lol, I would never leave you like granny did.
